## Research Abstract
The Knight shift is a critical probe in the study of high-temperature superconductivity. It provides insights into the interplay between electronic states and magnetic
nuclei interactions. This research focuses on the Knight shift in the context of a
2D Hubbard model, exploring the interacting quantum systems and electronic correlations using a new computational tool called AMI (Algorithmic Matsubara integration). The Hubbard model provides a foundational framework for understanding
electron-electron correlations, and the Knight shift emerges as a key observatory for
characterizing these interactions due to its effects on the resonance frequency in the
NMR experiments.
Specifically, we examine the suppression of the Knight shift, which signifies the
formation of a partial gap in the density of electronic states. To comprehensively
understand the behavior of electrons in the Knight shift conditions, we employ perturbation theory within the 2D Hubbard model framework. This approach establishes
a clear relationship between susceptibility and temperature across various doping levels, chemical potential, and density of states.
Our research addresses the significance of half-filling in the 2D Hubbard model,
examining the connections between the density of states and chemical potential for
different doping levels. We also explored the relationship between the Hubbard interaction constant (U), magnetic susceptibility (Ï‡sp), temperature, and doping.
